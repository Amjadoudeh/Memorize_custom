//
//  ContentView.swift
//  Memorize_custom
//
//  Created by Amjad Oudeh on 11.10.21.
//
//Required Tasks
//1. Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. Type in all the code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere.

//2. You can remove the ⊖ and ⊕ buttons at the bottom of the screen.
//3. Add a title “Memorize!” to the top of the screen.
//4. Add at least 3 “theme choosing” buttons to your UI, each of which causes all of the
//cards to be replaced with new cards that contain emoji that match the chosen theme.
//You can use Vehicles from lecture as one of the 3 themes if you want to, but you are
//welcome to create 3 (or more) completely new themes.
//5. The number of cards in each of your 3 themes should be different, but in no case
//fewer than 8.
//6. The cards that appear when a theme button is touched should be in an unpredictable
//(i.e. random) order. In other words, the cards should be shuffled each time a theme
//button is chosen.
//7. The theme-choosing buttons must include an image representing the theme and text
//describing the theme stacked on top of each other vertically.
//8. The image portion of each of the theme-choosing buttons must be created using an
//SF Symbol which evokes the idea of the theme it chooses (like the car symbol and the
//Vehicles theme shown in the Screenshot section below).
//9. The text description of the theme-choosing buttons must use a noticeably smaller font
//than the font we chose for the emoji on the cards.
//10.Your UI should work in portrait or landscape on any iPhone. This probably will not
//require any work on your part (that’s part of the power of SwiftUI), but be sure to
//experiment with running on different simulators in Xcode to be sure.
